A simple script for dumping all the mysql databases on an Ubuntu box and backing them up with https://github.com/zertrin/duplicity-backup

Going to be using this for the OpenAustralia Foundation

Before you start:
cp duplicity-backup.conf.example duplicity-backup.conf

And set
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
PASSPHRASE
in duplicity-backup.conf
